If E was going to go through anyway, I tended to feel the balls were not responsible, except in cases where one knocked it off course and the other was necessary to knock it back on. In some cases, I guessed that if one ball had been absent, a collision with the other ball would have still resulted in the same outcome, in which case I might not have considered a ball responsible even though it was involved. There were times when I wished I could control how many replays I viewed: in several cases, I felt ready to decide after one viewing, but in a few cases I wished I could have viewed once or twice more to better gauge what would have happened without certain events."174.28.39.160,19/11/2013,8F923B24-13E1-67DF-27CF-729E9E5FAA1C,"2,0,0,0,35,35,20,0,0,0,88,79,4,0,0,0,91,92,1,0,0,0,52,51,15,0,0,0,86,85,14,0,0,0,43,49,32,0,0,0,0,91,31,0,0,0,45,45,23,0,0,0,0,83,30,0,0,0,62,62,8,0,0,0,13,78,25,0,0,0,5,88,22,0,0,0,86,9,19,0,0,0,81,45,18,0,0,0,84,84,29,0,0,0,81,65,3,0,0,0,92,94,28,0,0,0,93,0,6,0,0,0,88,0,24,0,0,0,55,84,17,0,0,0,84,83,9,0,0,0,0,92,11,0,0,0,94,0,5,0,0,0,93,0,10,0,0,0,0,87,16,0,0,0,93,0,26,0,0,0,87,29,21,0,0,0,77,26,27,0,0,0,63,0,12,0,0,0,82,81,13,0,0,0,83,0,7,0,0,0,63,80","1,38,4,10,17.835133333333335,1,1,9",They were responsible for E going through or missing the gate whenvever they directly or indirectly caused it to go through.98.249.2.201,19/11/2013,2E2D1C5A-CAE4-C4D1-ADED-729FF4BAF3F0,"10,0,0,0,75,34,8,0,0,0,100,0,31,0,0,0,84,14,5,0,0,0,83,5,16,0,0,0,100,0,13,0,0,0,89,6,9,0,0,0,100,0,29,0,0,0,53,52,26,0,0,0,100,0,11,0,0,0,0,100,27,0,0,0,3,95,18,0,0,0,47,48,19,0,0,0,50,50,28,0,0,0,0,100,15,0,0,0,49,49,22,0,0,0,0,100,21,0,0,0,4,93,17,0,0,0,5,95,3,0,0,0,48,48,12,0,0,0,2,96,7,0,0,0,49,49,6,0,0,0,8,83,32,0,0,0,100,0,20,0,0,0,92,6,24,0,0,0,50,50,14,0,0,0,74,18,4,0,0,0,49,49,25,0,0,0,16,77,2,0,0,0,50,50,1,0,0,0,12,87,30,0,0,0,48,47,23,0,0,0,0,0","1,45,6,10,17.009733333333333,2,1,9",I chose the one that seemed to make more of an impact of E going through the gate or not.96.58.105.20,19/11/2013,D367E567-C34F-4FC3-AAE4-72A125BA01D7,"3,0,0,0,100,99,31,0,0,0,98,98,29,0,0,0,20,3,24,0,0,0,77,97,27,0,0,0,5,100,16,0,0,0,98,2,7,0,0,0,99,1,20,0,0,0,55,55,19,0,0,0,76,51,28,0,0,0,98,2,26,0,0,0,2,2,22,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,2,2,9,0,0,0,2,3,30,0,0,0,2,2,8,0,0,0,1,99,17,0,0,0,2,2,5,0,0,0,2,2,23,0,0,0,2,2,11,0,0,0,100,2,21,0,0,0,2,2,25,0,0,0,2,2,18,0,0,0,2,2,13,0,0,0,2,2,12,0,0,0,89,5,4,0,0,0,52,51,6,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,10,0,0,0,2,2,14,0,0,0,2,2,15,0,0,0,80,80,32,0,0,0,2,98","1,57,5,9,20.58595,1,1,9","Yes, showing the picture 3 times  created a confusing memory for me at times.
